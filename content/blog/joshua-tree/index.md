A tree, grotesque and forbidding in aspect, but with a weird sort of beauty, looming black
against the pale desert landscape, with a great, thick, rough trunk, fifteen to thirty feet high,
and a few thick, contorted branches, stretching out like a giant's arm and pointing ominously
across the sandy waste.

The branches are thatched with the shaggy husks of dead leaves and from their tips they thrust
out a great bunch of dagger-like leaves and a big, pondrous cluster of pallid, greenish flowers
or heavy, yellowish fruits.

This grows in the Mohave Desert and is at its best around Hesperia, where one may see the most
fantastic forest that it is possible to imagine.
